# Medical referrals

## Assumption of the project
I have noticed that family member got in paper a medical referral for different tests. I came up with an idea to create an app allowing users to prescribe relevant tests (doctor) as well as to see prescribed tests and to print them (patients)  

## Overview

1. Welcome page with tabs to create users or log in
